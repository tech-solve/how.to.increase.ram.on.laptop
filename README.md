Increasing your RAM is a reasonably inexpensive and straightforward procedure. All you’ll need is a RAM card (which should only set you back a few dollars) and a few minutes out of your time.

**Here’s how to increase the RAM of your laptop.**


## Determine the System Specifications of Your Laptop.
Should you consider increasing the RAM on your laptop, you should first learn about its system specifications. These are the properties of your laptop that determine how much RAM it can accommodate.

**To find out about your system specifications, follow these steps:**

1. Press the Windows Key + X.
2. You should see a pop-up menu on the left.
3. From the menu, select “System”.
4. A new window should open up with all the information related to your device specifications.
5. Take note of the “System type” and the “amount of RAM installed” on your system.


## Installation of the New RAM

**To install the new RAM, follow these steps:**

1. Switch off your laptop by navigating to “Windows > Power>Power Off.”

2. Detach any external cables from your laptop. These include charging cables, USB cables, and headphones.


3. Put on an anti-static wristband to avoid demagnetizing some sensitive parts of your computer. In addition, wearing this band protects you from electrical shocks.

4. Detach your laptop’s back panel. Ensure you follow the instructions in your user manual to make sure you’re opening the right panel.

5. Detach the old RAM cards from their respective RAM slots.

6. Insert the RAM cards into their respective RAM slots. The notches on both the slot and the card should help you through this process.

7. Close up the back panel of your laptop.
 
8. Turn on your computer. It should automatically detect the new RAM.

9. Your computer will automatically start using the new RAM, and you won’t be required to take any additional action.
